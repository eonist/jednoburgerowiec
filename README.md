## what the hell is this, Jan

Glad you asked! I'm trying to get a German citizenship next year (2021), and
one of the things you need to do to get one, is to pass a "citizenship test"
("Einbürgerungstest").

Since I'm a huge dumbass and I love to procrastinate, I decided I'll make an
app to help me study for it.

## ...why tho

You asked the same question I did like 10 times while writing this! iunno,
seemed like good idea at the moment! Of course I could just make an Anki deck
with questions, on just download one of the 15 apps that do that on the App
Store already, but that doesn't help me procrastinate, now does it

## ok, i guess...

so, the app is made in SwiftUI, should work everywhere from macOS to iPads to
iPhones, and is ugly as hell.

also it's my first app written in swiftui, so you know. code bad, probably.

## screenshots?

maybe later

## ok, but how did u get the questions tho

the bamf ("Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge"") helpfully publishes
a [full list][bamf], so that was easy. haha gotchu, it's a horrible pdf, 
and i am not touching scraping PDFs with a ten-foot pole.

instead i scraped questions from some third-party site that helps you prepare.
sorry!

## whats up with the name tho

it's a horrible pun in polish based on the german word for the test. don't
think about it. it's bad.
